What I used to develop my portfolio: <br>
* **ThreeJS** - A powerful 3D graphics library for rendering and animating the 3D model <br>
* **React Three Fiber** - A popular library for creating 3D graphics with ThreeJS in React <br>
* **TailwindCSS** - A popular utility-first CSS styling framework <br>
* **Framer Motion** - The most popular library used to bring your React website to life with animations <br>
* **EmailJS** - Implement sending emails through a form on the website <br>

I also ensured responsiveness across all devices and improve my website performance using **Suspense** and **Preload**. <br>
